Input:   
            -"reps - Repetitions +1"
            -"Nn   - Vector of to simulate curves per trail"
            -"Tt   - Vector of to simulate observations per curve"

Output:     
            -"meanM - Matrix of Mean MSE with entries for each value of Nn and Tt"
            -"varV  - Matrix of variances of MSE with entries for each value of Nn and Tt"
            -"medM  - Matrix of medians of MSE with entries for each value of Nn and Tt"
            -"iqrM  - Matrix of IQR of MSE with entries for each value of Nn and Tt"
