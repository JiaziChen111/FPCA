## Functional Principal Component Analysis for Derivatives of High-Dimensional Spatial Curves 
#### Authors: Maria Grith, Wolfgang K.HÃ¤rdle, Alois Kneip and Heiko Wagner

Smooth derivatives of high-dimensional spatial curves with joint functional variation are estimated from noisy discrete observations. Two related approaches based on the functional principal component analysis (FPCA) are used.

Simulation study: The methodology is used to estimate state price density (SPD) surfaces from call option prices. The finite sample behavior of the two approaches is studied.
